For anyone wondering where did the previous commit history go, the old repo was privated and migrated to the new one. Why? Simply because i myself, have gotten lost in my past un-descriptive commit messages. Moving forward I'll keep the repositories public for 2 reasons
## Feedback  
I genuinely appreciate constructive criticism, so if you find anything that could have been done better/improved, hmu @ [My contacts](https://contact.mero.lol)

## Descriptive commit messages  
So, previously I had the issue where my commit messages were pretty... undescriptiveâ€”sometimes containing just one word or even random keyboard mash. To stop this, I'll keep the repo public so this doesn't happen again.
